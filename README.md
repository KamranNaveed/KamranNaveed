# Hi there üëã

Thanks for visiting my profile! I am Kamran Naveed Syed, a **Fullstack Software Engineer** with a passion for tackling new challenges and broadening my technical and personal horizon. The following is a list of some basic information about me:

üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him. 

üó£ Name Pronunciation: *Kaahm-raahn*

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and skills, and am constantly seeking out new challenges and learning opportunities. Whether it's diving into a new     programming language or tackling a particularly complex problem, I thrive on the process of discovery and growth that comes with learning something new. 

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning GraphQL and Django.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on developing a recommender web app (that's actually good) centered around one of my interests, anime.

üß© Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from travelling, to tinkering, to cooking my favorite ethnic cuisine. (I would also like to learn an instrument or two sometime in the future).

üìö I love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. Some of my recommendations are [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad) by Robert Kiyosaki and [The Upward Spiral](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413760-the-upward-spiral?ref=nav_sb_noss_l_8) by Alex Korb.

## My Skills:

My main expertise is web development using the Javascript ecosystem, but I consider myself a generalist who can adapt to technology specific paradigms and use language agnostic problem solving to arrive at solutions. Here is a (ever-expanding) list of my skills:
